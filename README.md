# devkits-frontend
Website for the Unikits project and Associated Integrations.

This website is a prototype for the Unikits Project. It has a login page which lets users connect any supported walletconnect wallet to the dapp. This information is used to query airstack to authenticate if the user has an ENS address or Lens ID.

Users can then view a dashboard which contains a Uniswap Widget and Social analytics, including your last followed user and last swap.
